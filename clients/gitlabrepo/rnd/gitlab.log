** INTENT: ENABLE SCORECARD TO INTERFACE WITH GITLAB IN ADDITION TO IT'S CURRENT INTERFACES (i.e. github) **

08-09-2022
-> built initial build for scorecard
-> began reading through githubrepo directory files
-> raw_dependencies.go (./dependencydiff/raw_dependencies.go) will need implementation

09-09-2022
-> first stakeholders meetings
-> discovered https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab, which will do most of (if not all) of the gitlab integration
-> created basic client outline
-> setup gitlabclient skeleton
-> wrote basics of languages.go which handles extracting the languages used in a given gitlab project
    -> eventually I will need to get rid of a placeholder value that will be the number of files in a project
-> wrote basics of releases.go which handles the extracting of data from the various project releases
-> wrote basics of contributors.go which handles finding all of the contributors to a gitlab project
-> wrote basics of repo.go which handles creating the repoURL for a gitlab project
-> begun writing tarball.go (still have a lot of work to go)

12-09-2022
-> begun work on searchCommits.go which handles searching through the commits in a gitlab project (DONE)
-> begun work on statuses.go
    -> statuses in github relies on an external tool that is github exclusive
    -> may need to find a workaround in the future
-> wrote basics of tarball.go which handles getting a tarball of the file from gitlab so we can make less requests to
    the gitlab api.
-> I now understand that the relative files are not important and the only file it is important to fill out is
    the client.go file whereas the other files are all supporting files
-> Total client.go methods complete: 15
-> Total client.go methods to-go: 10
